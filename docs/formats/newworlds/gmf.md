# Star Trek: New Worlds: `.gmf` maps

Status: **first look**. Stored in the planet archives (`alnwrld`, `alpwrld`,
`deswrld`, `icewrld`, `redwrld`, `vlcwrld`) with chunk tag `0x11`, 3 to 7 per
archive, mostly 380–470 KB (`kurt64.gmf` in `icewrld` is 166 KB). Each
archive also holds that planet's ground tiles (`geo/map/alp/alpin_01.geo`
…, 93 in `alpwrld`) and terrain textures (`lbp/txr/map/alp/green01`,
`cliff01`, `brid01`, …). Worked out from the start of `coverd2.gmf`, October
2026. `reluva-tool gmf-info <file>` walks the layout below.

All values little-endian.

```
0x00   u16 count of type-21 records   376 in coverd2, 12 in kurt64
0x02   u16 count of type-20 records   376, 12
0x04   u16 count of type-19 records   749, 6
0x06   u16 grid width, u16 height     64 x 64, 32 x 32
0x0a   the records, in that order: u16 type, u16 length, u16 ? (0 so far),
       then length bytes
...    data of unknown layout up to the end of the file
```

| Type | Length | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 21 | 148–155 | one per tile (see below): small items `00 00 00 k 00 80 00`, many `02 ff ff ff ff ff` |
| 20 | 338–362 | one per tile: u32 its own number (0, 1, …), u32 0, u32 ?, u32 `0x18000`, u16 ?, then 8 × 8 byte grids (5, plus 0–3 8-byte items); values such as 2, 8, `0b`, `0d`, `0e`, perhaps terrain textures per cell |
| 19 | 22 | a 2 × 2 **block** of tiles: 6 bytes (0), then four u32 tile numbers, e.g. (0, 1, 3, 2), (4, 5, 6, 7), (8, 5, 6, 7) |

So the type-21 and type-20 counts are the number of distinct **tiles** (each
with two records), type 19 builds 2 × 2 **blocks** from them, and the header's
grid is in blocks: `kurt64` is 32 × 32 blocks = 64 × 64 tiles, as its name
says. Ground-tile models (`geo/map/...`) also have an 8 × 8 face grid.

After the records: a u32 (37092 in `kurt64`, 39607 in `coverd2`), then 4-byte
entries such as `67 5b d8 00` (the third byte always has its top bit set),
separated by `ff ff ff ff`.

## Open questions

- What the type-21 records and the type-20 grids hold, which ground-tile
  model each tile uses, and where units and buildings are placed.
- The data after the records (most of the file).
